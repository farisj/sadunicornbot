I haven't stopped crying.
I wish I could stab myself with my horn.
I wish I was never born.
Release me of my misery.
I want to sleep and never wake up.
Take me now,  Goddess.
Is this the darkest realm?
I need a friend.
Someone be my friend plz
I'm all alone by a tree rn
I'm jumping off the waterfall tn
Also the Orange Bull is our leader.
Fuck Orange Bull’s Kingdom.
I can't remember the last time I smiled.
Guess where my agony is from?
If I had a heart it would be broken.
If I had wings I’d follow Icarus	.
I'm not getting out of bed anymore.
I'm calling in sick tomorrow.
I don't recognize the Kingdom anymore.
The Kingdom is doomed.
Well it finally happened.
The other Kingdoms are laughing at us.
Why was I born a unicorn?
Life is meaningless.
My family is dead.
I have no friends.
I hate when villagers stare at my horn.
Happiness is a lie.
Love doesn't exist.
I forget what it's like to feel things.
Everyone hates me.
I shed a single tear.
I felt nothing.
I watched it all, emotionless
I threw up in my mouth.
I'm so alone.
